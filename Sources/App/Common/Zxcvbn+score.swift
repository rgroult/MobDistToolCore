          threat model -- stolen hash catastrophe scenario

          * passwords are stored as salted hashes, different random salt per user.
             (making rainbow attacks infeasable.)
          * hashes and salts were stolen. attacker is guessing passwords at max rate.
          * attacker has several CPUs at their disposal.
          * for a hash function like bcrypt/scrypt/PBKDF2, 10ms per guess is a safe lower bound.
          * (usually a guess would take longer -- this assumes fast hardware and a small work factor.)
          * adjust for your site accordingly if you use another hash function, possibly by
          * several orders of magnitude!
